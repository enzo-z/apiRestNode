# apiRestNode
Building an API to test with 3rd party software just so I can feel more confident on my understanding of API's and stuff

# I PROBABLY WILL DO A BASIC FRONT END FOR THIS ONE!

## How it works

So, I honestly decided to build this because I was getting formal education about API's and more specifically, about REST API's and why REST is the standard for many API's models etc

I did this API to send data about my friends. You can get via this little project the name, age, a memory about this friend and the location. I decided to learn how to handle GeoJSON and basic geolocation on MongoDB etc, so the API will send to you the friends stored in DB in a 100km of the coordinates you pass via URL. 
I will probably will build a basic form just so that I will have a screen to show this working lol
